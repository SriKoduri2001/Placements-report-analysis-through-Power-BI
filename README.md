I have imported the large data set from my college website the placement data, and from their I have performed normalization technique to remove duplicate data. Then I have created my database and loaded my excel sheet into Mango DB. I had used ODBC connecter to connect my power Bi to Mango DB, and I had created report in power BI based on data that is given in dataset. The reports that I have produced is very helpful to understand the number of people that are placed with highest salary, and which course of students are placed with good salary package.
